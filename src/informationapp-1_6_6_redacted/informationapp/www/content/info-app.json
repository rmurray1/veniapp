If your VA women’s health/primary care provider notices something abnormal with your female organs, you will be referred for evaluation by a gynecologist.  Depending on where you live and the resources at your VA site of care, you may see a gynecologist at the VA or a gynecologist in your community.  The gynecologist will take a history, do an examination, and order any needed tests to find out whether the abnormality is or is not caused by a female cancer.  <ul class='ia-qa-answer'></ul></li><li class='ia-qa-answer-line'>If you develop a cancer of the female organs (vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries), you will receive any needed care with a team of cancer specialists (oncologists) and other providers.  Depending on your condition, this team may include a Gyn Oncologist (an ob/gyn with special training in cancers of the female organs) or surgical oncologist, a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, a pharmacist, a nutritionist, a social worker, and others to provide the support and medical care you need. <ul class='ia-qa-answer'></ul></li></ul></div></div>"
